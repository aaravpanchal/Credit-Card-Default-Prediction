# **Project Summary -**

In recent years, the credit card issuers in Taiwan faced the cash and credit card debt crisis and the delinquency is expected to peak in the third quarter of 2006 (Chou,2006). In order to increase market share, card-issuing banks in Taiwan over-issued cash and credit cards to unqualified applicants. At the same time, most cardholders, irrespective of their repayment ability, overused credit card for consumption and accumulated heavy credit and cashâ€“card debts. The crisis caused the blow to consumer finance confidence and it is a big challenge for both banks and cardholders.

This Project Aims to create a predictive model that will help banks to predict whether the user default next month. Which will further help them to take prevention measures.

# **Problem Statement**

We are required to do:

*  Understand, prep the data and make it ready for training.

*  Assessing target features for class imbalance.

*  Modeling

*  Evaluation while keeping class imbalance in mind.

*  Feature Importance and Conclusion

*  Understanding how this project is useful to stakeholders.

Our Project Workflow:

*  Importing Libraries
